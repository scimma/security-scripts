Vault.py is a command to download the SCiMMA
Cloudtrail data into a directory under your login
area, $HOME/.trailscraper.

Downloads are incremental -- previous downloads are not
re-fetched or deleted.

Other tools (notably find_by_content.py) based
on trailscraper use the downloaded data for analysis.
