Vault.py is a command to download the SCIMMA
cloudtrail data into a directory under your login
area, $HOME/.trailscaper.

DOwnload are incremental -- previous  dowloads are not
re-fetched  or deleted.

Other tools (noteably find_by_content.py) based
on trailscraper use the downloaded data for analysis.
